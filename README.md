# Complex Calculator

## Description

This project is an **assignment** for our **Software Engineering** class at **Universit√° degli Studi di Salerno**. 

The assignment is about developing a scientific calculator that operates on complex numbers. 

The assignment is not focused on completing the project or on implementing it as efficiently as possible, but rather it is focused on using the tools and the techniques we studied during the class, such as SCRUM Agile Methodologies, version control, testing, design patterns and more.
Each member of the team is expected to work 10 hours a week for three weeks.
